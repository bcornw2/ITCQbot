Once you get the A+, and have a                     reliable understanding of how computers work, make a resume and post it in the resume thread.                      Then, send out your resume to any company looking for Helpdesk, Desktop Support, or Tier 1 positions.                      Be aware of your location, as that is often the most important determining                     factor in IT wages and opportunities.

 Reply: Your post contained the words: ['high school', 'getting started', 'noob'], which may mean you are just beginning your IT career journey, and are seeking advice. It is commonly suggested that people new to IT get the [CompTIA A+ certification](https://comptia.org/certifications/a), even if you think it looks too easy. While studying for this, start working on personal projects like securing your home network or building a NAS out of a RasPi - check /r/homelab and /r/raspberrypi for more ideas, or reply to this comment with:  "IDEAS:" `<topic>` and I will reply a list of beginner-friendly home-lab project ideas to help you learn the basic of networking, security, sysadmin, coding, and other IT topics. Once you get the A+, and have a reliable understanding of how computers work, make a resume and post it in the resume thread. Then, send out your resume to any company looking for Helpdesk, Desktop Support, Field Tech, or Tier 1 positions, for your entry into the world of IT. Be aware that your location is often the most important determining factor in IT wages and opportunities.
